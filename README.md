In Projects, the Assignment is the README.md file, and Q & A assets are the other files included in the github repository. First one is basically modify the PHP loop and also work with git against a real-world problem (part 2 of assignment #1 above is to add bootstrap to create 3x3 grid of images and headers). 

Before the [1st assignment](https://github.com/Karma-Tech-Consulting/apprentice-php-portfolio) they complete the following (all codeacademy is free):

* HTML @ codeacademy - http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web
* PHP @ codeacademy - http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/php
* Then they can try to complete the first assignment(https://github.com/Karma-Tech-Consulting/apprentice-php-portfolio) and the following classes will help them get through it, and so does skyping their mentor. In my business model involving my interns, I'm the mentor to them, and trying to get contracts so that these interns can have real world problems to solve and get paid, now that they have some training.
* Then: Codeacademy "Make a Website" - "3 hours"
* Then Code School "Try Git" - (still only doing free courses on code school, code school git path) Learn this - hard. Do additional other research about Git and about Github and about version control system(google each of those words/phrases) ...
* Code School "Discover DevTools" - (free code school elective path)

Then, after these Assignment #1 and those classes are completed, these next classes are assigned and then [Assignment #2](https://github.com/Karma-Tech-Consulting/tdd-javascript), is assigned.  

* Then Code School "Javascript Road Trip Part 1" - (free code school javascript path)
* Then Codeacademy "Javascript" - "10 hours"
* Then Code School "Try jQuery" - (free code school javascript path)

All in all the classes listed above can take nearly 30-60 hours if the person is taking notes and following along closely. On codeacademy alone it is more than 200 excercises, plus a good amount of points on code school. (100 or more excercises)

The idea is basically expose to real world problems, and have them submit the code on github.

I give those assignments to them after I instruct them to take free courses online so that they understand the assignment, project, or other problem I can give them. The classes are free and provide a benefit to them in that they have solid things to put on their resumes, for example: 
 * https://www.codecademy.com/Devon.Warmack
 * https://www.codecademy.com/jjones4031
 * https://www.codecademy.com/Akulanite
 * https://www.codeschool.com/users/juliusakula

The idea is basically expose them to real world problems, and have them submit the code on github; teach them how to them how to ask questions on stack overflow, how to read the javascript console and interpret error messages, HTTP communication, the difference between backend and frontend, recommending IDEs, all during skype calls to supplement the exposure to acquire their own solutions for their given assignments, and practice speaking technical language.
